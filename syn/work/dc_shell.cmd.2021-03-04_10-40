#@ #	The variables in this file define the behavior of many parts
#@ #	of the Synopsys Synthesis Tools.  Upon installation, they should 
#@ #	be reviewed and modified to fit your site's needs.  Each engineer
#@ #	can have a .synopsys file in his/her home directory or current
#@ #	directory to override variable settings in this file.  
#@ #
#@ #  	Each logical grouping of variables is commented as to their 
#@ #	nature and effect on the Synthesis Commands.  Examples of
#@ #	variable groups are the Compile Variable Group, which affects 
#@ #	the designs produced by the COMPILE command, and the Schematic 
#@ #	Variable Group, which affects the output of the create_schematic
#@ #	command.
#@ #
#@ #	You can type "man <group_name>_variables" in dc_shell or 
#@ #	design_analyzer to get help about a group of variables.
#@ #	For instance, to get help about the "system" variable group, 
#@ #	type "help system_variables".  You can also type
#@ #	"man <variable name>", to get help on the that variable's 
#@ #	group.

#@ #
#@ # Searching for Tcl Modules. Defines a procedure, declares it as the primary
#@ # command for finding packages, however also uses the former 'package unknown'
#@ # command as a fallback.
#@ #
#@ # Locates all possible packages in a directory via a less restricted glob. The
#@ # targeted directory is derived from the name of the requested package, i.e.
#@ # the TM scan will look only at directories which can contain the requested
#@ # package. It will register all packages it found in the directory so that
#@ # future requests have a higher chance of being fulfilled by the ifneeded
#@ # database without having to come to us again.
#@ #
#@ # We do not remember where we have been and simply rescan targeted directories
#@ # when invoked again. The reasoning is this:
#@ #
#@ # - The only way we get back to the same directory is if someone is trying to
#@ #   [package require] something that wasn't there on the first scan.
#@ #
#@ #   Either
#@ #   1) It is there now:  If we rescan, you get it; if not you don't.
#@ #
#@ #      This covers the possibility that the application asked for a package
#@ #      late, and the package was actually added to the installation after the
#@ #      application was started. It shoukld still be able to find it.
#@ #
#@ #   2) It still is not there: Either way, you don't get it, but the rescan
#@ #      takes time. This is however an error case and we dont't care that much
#@ #      about it
#@ #
#@ #   3) It was there the first time; but for some reason a "package forget" has
#@ #      been run, and "package" doesn't know about it anymore.
#@ #
#@ #      This can be an indication that the application wishes to reload some
#@ #      functionality. And should work as well.
#@ #
#@ # Note that this also strikes a balance between doing a glob targeting a
#@ # single package, and thus most likely requiring multiple globs of the same
#@ # directory when the application is asking for many packages, and trying to
#@ # glob for _everything_ in all subdirectories when looking for a package,
#@ # which comes with a heavy startup cost.
#@ #
#@ # We scan for regular packages only if no satisfying module was found.

#@ #  ABSTRACT     This file contains the  Tcl procedure verify_ilm. verify_ilm
#@ #               can be run inside psyn_shell and dc_shell to verify the 
#@ #               correctnesss of ILM models. This script is based on PrimeTime 
#@ #               script verify_model.tcl.
#@ #
#@ #  HISTORY:    
#@ #       Mar 27 2001 - Sriram Ananth : Created.
#@ #       Jul 17 2002 - William K. Foster : Put ?: expressions in {curly braces}
#@ #                         to account for fact these are now evaluated whereas
#@ #                         before they were complied inline.  The compiler was
#@ #                         accepting the old syntax, but the interpreter does
#@ #                         not.  The reason for this change is the addition of a
#@ #                         Tcl trace in /vobs/syn/sh/dcsh_teqn.c, the presence
#@ #                         of which prohibits inline compilation.
#@ #       Jun 18, 2008 - Malleswara Gupta: Added Tag_name for useful for MCMM case.
#@ #                         Modified the output to print tag_name and port/pin name
#@ #                         on every line. Added capability to specify through_cells
#@ #                         meant for ILM verification in top-level context

#@ # PROCEDURE:  verify_ilm
#@ #
#@ # ABSTRACT:  
#@ #       Verify the worst case slacks both from the input ports and to the output
#@ #       ports of the ILM model by comparing these with the original design. For 
#@ #       each port, all four worst slacks are considered: min_fall, min_rise, 
#@ #       max_fall and max_rise.The script does not verify all paths exhaustively 
#@ #       as that could easily become too large.
#@ #       
#@ #
#@ # SYNOPSIS:
#@ #       verify_ilm -mode mode [-data_label label] 
#@ #                         [-ignore_port port_list] [-output_file file_name]
#@ #                         [-tolerance float_number] 
#@ #
#@ # OPTIONS:    
#@ #       -mode   This is a required option to specify the mode of the current run.
#@ #               The value can only be either "save" or "verify". 
#@ #               If you use value "save",  the timing data are gathered and saved 
#@ #               as references internally by Tcl arrays. They are not written out 
#@ #               to any files. If you use value "verify", the data for the model 
#@ #               are gathered and then compared against the reference data saved 
#@ #               during the run for the design.
#@ #              
#@ #      -data_label  This is not a required option. The values can be any string. 
#@ #               be used to label the data so that it's possible to do multiple
#@ #               comparisons  against one set of reference data obtained during
#@ #               one run for the design.  Default value is "DESIGN" for "save"
#@ #               mode and "MODEL" for "verify" mode.
#@ #
#@ #      -tag_name This is not a required option. The default value is "default". 
#@ #               This can be useful in MCMM case by tagging the data of a scenario
#@ #               in "save" step so that it can be retrieved later and compared with
#@ #               the corresponding tagged data during verify step.
#@ #
#@ #       -through_cells This option is not a required option when verifying the 
#@ #               model against design independently. This option is required if
#@ #               the top-level linked with a model is to be compared with top-level
#@ #               linked with the reference design (or other model). The list of 
#@ #               cells specifies the cells of interest for comparing timing paths
#@ #               through them. Example, when Top is linked with the ILMs, the list
#@ #               ILM instances  (say {I_ALU I_STACK_TOP} ) will need to be specified.
#@ #               The timing comparison will happen for every pin of the cell and the
#@ #               worst paths going through that pin in the test design will be 
#@ #               compared with the reference design.
#@ #
#@ #       -reset_data This is not required option. When used along with -mode save
#@ #               this clear all the slack data stored by the script. This is recommended
#@ #               to clear any data due to earlier runs of verify_ilm if the same is
#@ #               multiple times with same tag name and -mode save.
#@ #
#@ #      -ignore_ports   You can exclude some ports by the use of -ignore_ports 
#@ #                option. The ports listed will be ignored and the timing 
#@ #                data on these ports will not be considered in the 
#@ #                verification. The default value is an empty list 
#@ #                so all the boundary IO ports will be considered.
#@ #
#@ #       -tolerance  A floating number specified as the tolerance value to decide 
#@ #                the result of comparisons of timing data. If the discrepancy 
#@ #                is larger than the tolerance, the verification on the port is 
#@ #                reported as FAILED, otherwise OK. The default tolerance value 
#@ #                is 0.1. Note that this tolerance assumes no unit, so you need
#@ #                to make sure that the number specified as tolerance makes 
#@ #                sense.
#@ #
#@ #       -output_file   To specify a file for writing out the final report. 
#@ #                The default  behavior is output to the stdout. Also, if there 
#@ #                is any error in opening the specified file, an error message 
#@ #                will  print out and report will be redirected to the stdout.

#@ #
#@ #  Used internally via "itk_component delete" when disconnecting a
#@ #  component <widget> from the mega-widget that contains it.
#@ #  Each component has a special binding for the <Destroy> event
#@ #  that causes it to disconnect itself from its parent when destroyed.
#@ #  This procedure removes the binding from the binding tag list and
#@ #  deletes the binding.  It is much easier to implement this in
#@ #  Tcl than C.

#@ # Calendar
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # Implements a calendar widget for the selection of a date.  It displays
#@ # a single month at a time.  Buttons exist on the top to change the 
#@ # month in effect turning th pages of a calendar.  As a page is turned, 
#@ # the dates for the month are modified.  Selection of a date visually 
#@ # marks that date.  The selected value can be monitored via the 
#@ # -command option or just retrieved using the get method.  Methods also
#@ # exist to select a date and show a particular month.  The option set
#@ # allows the calendars appearance to take on many forms.

#@ # CanvasPrintBox v1.5
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # Implements a print box for printing the contents of a canvas widget
#@ # to a printer or a file. It is possible to specify page orientation, the
#@ # number of pages to print the image on and if the output should be
#@ # stretched to fit the page.
#@ # 
#@ # CanvasPrintBox is a "super-widget" that can be used as an
#@ # element in ones own GUIs. It is used to print the contents
#@ # of a canvas (called the source hereafter) to a printer or a
#@ # file. Possible settings include: portrait and landscape orientation
#@ # of the output, stretching the output to fit the page while maintaining
#@ # a proper aspect-ratio and posterizing to enlarge the output to fit on
#@ # multiple pages. A stamp-sized copy of the source will be shown (called
#@ # the stamp hereafter) at all times to reflect the effect of changing
#@ # the settings will have on the output.

#@ # CanvasPrintDialog v1.5
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # Implements a print dialog for printing the contents of a canvas widget
#@ # to a printer or a file. It is possible to specify page orientation, the
#@ # number of pages to print the image on and if the output should be
#@ # stretched to fit the page. The CanvasPrintDialog is derived from the
#@ # Dialog class and is composed of a CanvasPrintBox with attributes set to
#@ # manipulate the dialog buttons.

#@ # Labeledframe
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # Implements a hull frame with a grooved relief, a label, and a
#@ # frame childsite.
#@ #
#@ # The frame childsite can be filled with any widget via a derived class
#@ # or though the use of the childsite method.  This class was designed
#@ # to be a general purpose base class for supporting the combination of
#@ # a labeled frame and a childsite.  The options include the ability to
#@ # position the label at configurable locations within the grooved relief
#@ # of the hull frame, and control the display of the label.
#@ #
#@ #  To following demonstrates the different values which the "-labelpos"
#@ #  option may be set to and the resulting layout of the label when
#@ #  one executes the following command with "-labeltext" set to "LABEL":
#@ #
#@ #  example:
#@ #   labeledframe .w -labeltext LABEL -labelpos <ne,n,nw,se,s,sw,en,e,es,wn,s,ws>

#@ # configuration by: adding the "-highlightthickness" option back into
#@ # the hull frame; configuring the "-highlightthickness" option to properly
#@ # place the label;  and then remove the "-highlightthickness" option from the
#@ # hull.

#@ # Labeledwidget
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # Implements a labeled widget which contains a label and child site.
#@ # The child site is a frame which can filled with any widget via a 
#@ # derived class or though the use of the childsite method.  This class
#@ # was designed to be a general purpose base class for supporting the 
#@ # combination of label widget and a childsite, where a label may be 
#@ # text, bitmap or image.  The options include the ability to position 
#@ # the label around the childsite widget, modify the font and margin, 
#@ # and control the display of the label.

#@ # Combobox
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # Implements a Combobox widget. A Combobox has 2 basic styles: simple and
#@ # dropdown. Dropdowns display an entry field with an arrow button to the 
#@ # right of it. When the arrow button is pressed a selectable list of
#@ # items is popped up. A simple Combobox displays an entry field and a listbox 
#@ # just beneath it which is always displayed. In both types, if the user 
#@ # selects an item in the listbox, the contents of the entry field are 
#@ # replaced with the text from the selected item. If the Combobox is 
#@ # editable, the user can type in the entry field and when <Return> is
#@ # pressed the item will be inserted into the list.
#@ #
#@ # WISH LIST:
#@ #	This section lists possible future enhancements.  
#@ #
#@ #	  Combobox 1.x:
#@ #		  - convert bindings to bindtags.

#@     # Added by csmith 12/11/01 to resolve SF ticket #474817.  It's an unusual
#@     # circumstance, but we need to make sure the character passed into this
#@     # method matches the last character in the entry's text string.  It's
#@     # possible to type fast enough that the _lookup method gets invoked
#@     # *after* multiple characters have been typed and *before* the first
#@     # character has been processed.  For example, you can type "bl" very
#@     # quickly, and by the time the interpreter processes "b", the "l" has
#@     # already been placed in the entry field.  This causes problems as noted
#@     # in the SF ticket.
#@     #
#@     # Thus, if the character currently being processed does not match the
#@     # last character in the entry field, reset the _inlookup flag and return.
#@     # Also, note that we're only concerned with single characters here, not
#@     # keys such as backspace, delete, etc.
#@     if {$key != [string range $text end end] && [string match ? $key]} {
#@       set _inlookup 0
#@       return
#@     }
#@ 
#@     #
#@     #		okay, so we have to do a lookup.  find the first match in the
#@     #		listbox to the text we've got in the entry field (glob).
#@     #		if one exists, clear the current listbox selection, and set it to
#@     #		the one we just found, making that one visible in the listbox.
#@     #		then, pick off the text from the listbox entry that hadn't yet been
#@     #		entered into the entry field.  we need to tack that text onto the
#@     #		end of the entry field, select it, and then set the insertion cursor
#@     #		back to just before the point where we just added that text.
#@     #		if one didn't exist, then just clear the listbox selection
#@     #
#@     set item [lsearch [$itk_component(list) get 0 end] "$text*" ]
#@     if {$item != -1} {
#@ 	$itk_component(list) selection clear 0 end
#@ 	$itk_component(list) selection set $item $item
#@ 	see $item
#@ 	set remainder [string range [$itk_component(list) get $item] $len end]

#@ # ::iwidgets::Disjointlistbox
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # Implements a widget which maintains a disjoint relationship between
#@ # the items displayed by two listboxes.  The disjointlistbox is composed
#@ # of 2 Scrolledlistboxes,  2 Pushbuttons, and 2 labels.
#@ #
#@ # The disjoint behavior of this widget exists between the two Listboxes,
#@ # That is, a given instance of a ::iwidgets::Disjointlistbox will never
#@ # exist which has Listbox widgets with items in common.
#@ #
#@ # Users may transfer items between the two Listbox widgets using the
#@ # the two Pushbuttons.
#@ #
#@ # The options include the ability to configure the "items" displayed by
#@ # either of the two Listboxes and to control the placement of the insertion
#@ # and removal buttons.
#@ #
#@ # The following depicts the allowable "-buttonplacement" option values
#@ # and their associated layout:
#@ #
#@ #   "-buttonplacement" => center

#@ # Extbutton
#@ #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # This [incr Widget] is pretty simple - it just extends the behavior of
#@ # the Tk button by allowing the user to add a bitmap or an image, which
#@ # can be placed at various locations relative to the text via the -imagepos
#@ # configuration option.
#@ #
#@ #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # IMPORTANT NOTE: This [incr Widget] will only work with Tk 8.4 or later.

#@ # Extfileselectionbox
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # Implements a file selection box that is a slightly extended version
#@ # of the OSF/Motif standard XmExtfileselectionbox composite widget.  
#@ # The Extfileselectionbox differs from the Motif standard in that the
#@ # filter and selection fields are comboboxes and the files and directory
#@ # lists are in a paned window.

#@ # Scrolledwidget
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # Implements a general purpose base class for scrolled widgets, by
#@ # creating the necessary horizontal and vertical scrollbars and 
#@ # providing protected methods for controlling their display.  The 
#@ # derived class needs to take advantage of the fact that the grid
#@ # is used and the vertical scrollbar is in row 0, column 2 and the
#@ # horizontal scrollbar in row 2, column 0.

#@ # given node as a list which will be depicted in the display.
#@ #
#@ # Since the names of the children are used as tags in the underlying 
#@ # text widget, each child must be unique in the hierarchy.  Due to
#@ # the unique requirement, the nodes shall be reffered to as uids 
#@ # or uid in the singular sense.

#@ #   where uid is a unique id and primary key for the hierarchy entry
#@ #
#@ # Should the unique requirement pose a problem, the list returned
#@ # can take on another more extended form which enables the 
#@ # association of text to be displayed with the uids.  The uid must
#@ # still be unique, but the text does not have to obey the unique
#@ # rule.  In addition, the format also allows the specification of
#@ # additional tags to be used on the same entry in the hierarchy
#@ # as the uid and additional icons to be displayed just before
#@ # the node.  The tags and icons are considered to be the property of
#@ # the user in that the hierarchy widget will not depend on any of 
#@ # their values.
#@ #
#@ #   {{uid [text [tags [icons]]]} {uid [text [tags [icons]]]} ...}

#@ #         tags is a list of user tags to be applied to the entry
#@ #         icons is a list of icons to be displayed in front of the text
#@ #
#@ # The hierarchy widget does a look ahead from each node to determine
#@ # if the node has a children.  This can be cost some performace with
#@ # large hierarchies.  User's can avoid this by providing a hint in
#@ # the user tags.  A tag of "leaf" or "branch" tells the hierarchy
#@ # widget the information it needs to know thereby avoiding the look

#@ # Menubar widget
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # The Menubar command creates a new window (given by the pathName 
#@ # argument) and makes it into a Pull down menu widget. Additional 
#@ # options, described above may be specified on the command line or 
#@ # in the option database to configure aspects of the Menubar such 
#@ # as its colors and font. The Menubar command returns its pathName 
#@ # argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist 
#@ # a window named pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.
#@ # 
#@ # A Menubar is a widget that simplifies the task of creating 
#@ # menu hierarchies. It encapsulates a frame widget, as well 
#@ # as menubuttons, menus, and menu entries. The Menubar allows 
#@ # menus to be specified and refer enced in a more consistent 
#@ # manner than using Tk to build menus directly. First, Menubar
#@ # allows a menu tree to be expressed in a hierachical "language". 
#@ # The Menubar accepts a menuButtons option that allows a list of 
#@ # menubuttons to be added to the Menubar. In turn, each menubutton
#@ # accepts a menu option that spec ifies a list of menu entries 
#@ # to be added to the menubutton's menu (as well as an option 
#@ # set for the menu).   Cascade entries in turn, accept a menu 
#@ # option that specifies a list of menu entries to be added to 
#@ # the cascade's menu (as well as an option set for the menu). In 
#@ # this manner, a complete menu grammar can be expressed to the 
#@ # Menubar. Additionally, the Menubar allows each component of 
#@ # the Menubar system to be referenced by a simple componentPathName 
#@ # syntax. Finally, the Menubar extends the option set of menu 
#@ # entries to include the helpStr option used to implement status 
#@ # bar help.

#@ # WISH LIST:
#@ #   This section lists possible future enhancements.

#@ # If the type is one of  cascade,  checkbutton,  command,
#@ # radiobutton,  or separator it adds a new entry to the bottom
#@ # of the menu denoted by the menuPath prefix of componentPath-
#@ # Name.  The  new entry's type is given by type. If additional
#@ # arguments are present, they  specify  options  available  to
#@ # component  type  Entry. See the man pages for menu(n) in the
#@ # section on Entries. In addition all entries accept an  added
#@ # option, helpStr:
#@ #
#@ #     -helpstr value
#@ #
#@ # Specifes the string to associate with  the  entry.
#@ # When the mouse moves over the associated entry, the variable
#@ # denoted by helpVariable is set. Another widget can  bind  to
#@ # the helpVariable and thus display status help.
#@ #
#@ # If the type is menubutton, it adds a new  menubut-
#@ # ton  to  the  menu bar. If additional arguments are present,
#@ # they specify options available to component type MenuButton.
#@ #
#@ # If the type is menubutton  or  cascade,  the  menu
#@ # option  is  available  in  addition to normal Tk options for

#@ # Messagebox
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # Implements an information messages area widget with scrollbars.
#@ # Message types can be user defined and configured.  Their options
#@ # include foreground, background, font, bell, and their display
#@ # mode of on or off.  This allows message types to defined as needed,
#@ # removed when no longer so, and modified when necessary.  An export
#@ # method is provided for file I/O.
#@ #
#@ # The number of lines that can be displayed may be limited with
#@ # the default being 1000. When this limit is reached, the oldest line 
#@ # is removed.  There is also support for saving the contents to a 
#@ # file, using a file selection dialog.
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ #
#@ # History:
#@ #   01/16/97 - Alfredo Jahn  Renamed from InfoMsgBox to MessageBox
#@ #       Initial release...
#@ #   01/20/97 - Alfredo Jahn  Add a popup window so that 3rd mouse
#@ #       button can be used to configure/access the message area.
#@ #       New methods added: _post and _toggleDebug.
#@ #   01/30/97 - Alfredo Jahn  Add -filename option
#@ #   05/11/97 - Mark Ulferts  Added the ability to define and configure 
#@ #       new types.  Changed print method to be issue.  
#@ #   09/05/97 - John Tucker Added export method.

#@ # Notebook Widget
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # The Notebook command creates a new window (given by the pathName 
#@ # argument) and makes it into a Notebook widget. Additional options, 
#@ # described above may be specified on the command line or in the 
#@ # option database to configure aspects of the Notebook such as its 
#@ # colors, font, and text. The Notebook command returns its pathName 
#@ # argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist 
#@ # a window named pathName, but path Name's parent must exist.
#@ # 
#@ # A Notebook is a widget that contains a set of pages. It displays one 
#@ # page from the set as the selected page. When a page is selected, the 
#@ # page's contents are displayed in the page area. When first created a 
#@ # Notebook has no pages. Pages may be added or deleted using widget commands 
#@ # described below.
#@ # 
#@ # A special option may be provided to the Notebook. The -auto option 
#@ # specifies whether the Nptebook will automatically handle the unpacking 
#@ # and packing of pages when pages are selected. A value of true signifies 
#@ # that the notebook will automatically manage it. This is the default 
#@ # value. A value of false signifies the notebook will not perform automatic 
#@ # switching of pages.

#@ # WISH LIST:
#@ #   This section lists possible future enhancements.

#@ # The Page command creates a new window (given by the pathName argument) 
#@ # and makes it into a Page widget. Additional options, described above 
#@ # may be specified on the com mand line or in the option database to 
#@ # configure aspects of the Page such as its back ground, cursor, and 
#@ # geometry. The Page command returns its pathName argument. At the time 
#@ # this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named pathName, 
#@ # but path Name's parent must exist.
#@ # 
#@ # A Page is a frame that holds a child site. It is nothing more than a 
#@ # frame widget with some intelligence built in. Its primary purpose is 
#@ # to support the Notebook's concept of a page. It allows another widget 
#@ # like the Notebook to treat a page as a single object. The Page has an 
#@ # associated label and knows how to return its child site.

#@ # Scrolledtext
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # Implements a scrolled text widget with additional options to manage
#@ # the vertical scrollbar.  This includes options to control the method
#@ # in which the scrollbar is displayed, i.e. statically or  dynamically.
#@ # Options also exist for adding a label to the scrolled text area and
#@ # controlling its position.  Import/export of methods are provided for 
#@ # file I/O.

#@ # Scrolledhtml
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # Implements a scrolled html text widget by inheritance from scrolledtext
#@ # Import reads from an html file, while export still writes plain text
#@ # Also provides a render command, to display html text passed in as an
#@ # argument.
#@ #
#@ # This widget is HTML3.2 compliant, with the following exceptions:
#@ #   a) nothing requiring a connection to an HTTP server is supported
#@ #   b) some of the image alignments aren't supported, because they're not
#@ #      supported by the text widget
#@ #   c) the br attributes that go with the image alignments aren't implemented
#@ #   d) background images are not supported, because they're not supported
#@ #      by the text widget
#@ #   e) automatic table/table cell sizing doesn't work very well.
#@ #
#@ # WISH LIST:
#@ #   This section lists possible future enhancements.
#@ #
#@ #   1) size tables better using dlineinfo.
#@ #   2) make images scroll smoothly off top like they do off bottom. (limitation
#@ #      of text widget?)
#@ #   3) add ability to get non-local URLs
#@ #       a) support forms
#@ #       b) support imagemaps
#@ #   4) keep track of visited links
#@ #   5) add tclets support
#@ #
#@ # BUGS:
#@ #   Cells in a table can be caused to overlap. ex:
#@ #      <table border width="100%">
#@ #      <tr><td>cell1</td><td align=right rowspan=2>cell2</td></tr>
#@ #      <tr><td colspan=2>cell3 w/ overlap</td>
#@ #      </table>
#@ #   It hasn't been fixed because 1) it's a pain to fix, 2) the fix would slow
#@ #   tables down by a significant amount, and 3) netscape has the same
#@ #   bug, as of V3.01, and no one seems to care.
#@ #
#@ #   In order to size tables properly, they must be visible, which causes an
#@ #   annoying jump from table to table through the document at render time.

#@ # Selectionbox
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # Implements a selection box composed of a scrolled list of items and
#@ # a selection entry field.  The user may choose any of the items displayed
#@ # in the scrolled list of alternatives and the selection field will be
#@ # filled with the choice.  The user is also free to enter a new value in
#@ # the selection entry field.  Both the list and entry areas have labels.
#@ # A child site is also provided in which the user may create other widgets
#@ # to be used in conjunction with the selection box.

#@ # Tabnotebook Widget
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ # The Tabnotebook command creates a new window (given by the pathName 
#@ # argument) and makes it into a Tabnotebook widget. Additional options, 
#@ # described above may be specified on the command line or in the option 
#@ # database to configure aspects of the Tabnotebook such as its colors, 
#@ # font, and text. The Tabnotebook command returns its pathName argument. 
#@ # At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window 
#@ # named pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.
#@ # 
#@ # A Tabnotebook is a widget that contains a set of tabbed pages. It 
#@ # displays one page from the set as the selected page. A Tab displays 
#@ # the label for the page to which it is attached and serves as a page 
#@ # selector.   When a page's tab is selected, the page's contents are 
#@ # displayed in the page area. The selected tab has a three-dimensional 
#@ # effect to make it appear to float above the other tabs. The tabs are 
#@ # displayed as a group along either the left, top, right, or bottom 
#@ # edge. When first created a Tabnotebook has no pages. Pages may be 
#@ # added or deleted using widget commands described below.
#@ # 
#@ # A special option may be provided to the Tabnotebook. The -auto 
#@ # option specifies whether the Tabnotebook will automatically handle 
#@ # the unpacking and packing of pages when pages are selected. A value 
#@ # of true sig nifies that the notebook will automatically manage it. This 
#@ # is the default value. A value of false signifies the notebook will not 
#@ # perform automatic switching of pages.

#@ # It displays these tabs in a row or column depending on it tabpos. 
#@ # When a tab is clicked on, it becomes the only tab in the tab set that 
#@ # is selected. All other tabs are deselected. The Tcl command prefix 
#@ # associated with this tab (through the command tab configure option) 
#@ # is invoked with the tab index number appended to its argument list. 
#@ # This allows the Tabset to control another widget such as a Notebook.
#@ #
#@ # A Tab class is an [incr Tcl] class that displays either an image, 
#@ # bitmap, or label in a graphic object on a canvas. This graphic object 
#@ # can have a wide variety of appearances depending on the options set. 
#@ #
#@ # WISH LIST:
#@ #   This section lists possible future enhancements.
#@ #
#@ #   1) When too many tabs appear, a small scrollbar should appear to
#@ #      move the tabs over.

#@ # Toolbar
#@ # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#@ #
#@ # The Toolbar command creates a new window (given by the pathName 
#@ # argument) and makes it into a Tool Bar widget. Additional options, 
#@ # described above may be specified on the command line or in the 
#@ # option database to configure aspects of the Toolbar such as its 
#@ # colors, font, and orientation. The Toolbar command returns its 
#@ # pathName argument. At the time this command is invoked, there 
#@ # must not exist a window named pathName, but pathName's parent 
#@ # must exist.
#@ # 
#@ # A Toolbar is a widget that displays a collection of widgets arranged 
#@ # either in a row or a column (depending on the value of the -orient 
#@ # option). This collection of widgets is usually for user convenience 
#@ # to give access to a set of commands or settings. Any widget may be 
#@ # placed on a Toolbar. However, command or value-oriented widgets (such 
#@ # as button, radiobutton, etc.) are usually the most useful kind of 
#@ # widgets to appear on a Toolbar.
#@ #
#@ # WISH LIST: 
#@ #   This section lists possible future enhancements.  
#@ #
#@ #	Toggle between text and image/bitmap so that the toolbar could
#@ #     display either all text or all image/bitmaps.
#@ #   Implementation of the -toolbarfile option that allows toolbar
#@ #     add commands to be read in from a file.
